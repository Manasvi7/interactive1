	<p> the first thing most people do is turn to social media, specifically Instagram, to find out everything they can about the person. This "investigation" that people perform can lead to embarssment and panic attacks if you liked a picture that was posted 92 days back. All lurking does is set people up for expectations, cancels out the excitement people usually build-up when they meet someone for the first time and makes people want things to be perfect, like it is representated in the pictures. This site helps users to track how much time they spend on lurking, if they wish to reduce it and also print out all the images they lurked at to help them realise how unhealthy it is. To download the extension <a div="link" href="Instragram_extension.zip">   click me  </a> and add it to your google chrome extension page. Hapyy lurking! </p>
