	<div id="long";>
	 <p><font color="white"> <font face="courier"> <font size="6">it’s that text itself is disappearing.

	 	<div id="para1";> After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading web magazines.</div>

	 	<div id="para2";> Then came blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. </div>

	 	<div id="para3";>Now it’s Facebook videos and Instagram and SnapChat that most people spend their time on. </div>

	 	<div id="para4";>There’s less and less text to read on social networks,</br> and more and more </br> video to watch, </br> more and more </br> images to look at.</div>

	 	<div id="para5";> Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening?</div>

	 	<div id="para6";>Is this trend driven by people’s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking?</div>

	 	<div id="para7";>I don’t know — that’s for researchers to find out — but it feels like it’s reviving old cultural wars. </div>

	 	<div id="para8";>After all, the web started out by imitating books and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext.</div>
	 	<div id="para9";>Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies — entire monopolies — were built off the back of them.</div>

	 	<div id="para10";> But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video cameras grows exponentially, this seems to be changing.</div>

	 	<div id="para11";>Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there. </div> 

	    <div id="para12";>But the Stream, mobile applications, and moving images: They all show a departure from books-internet toward a television-internet.</div> 

	    <div id="para13";>We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication — nodes and networks and links — toward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies.</div></font> </font>
