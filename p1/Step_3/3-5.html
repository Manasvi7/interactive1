it’s that text itself is <font size="1">disappearing.</font> After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading <font size="2">web magazines.</font> Then came blogs, then <font size="3">Facebook </font>, then <font size="4">Twitter </font>. Now it’s Facebook videos and <font size="5">Instagram</font> and <font size="6">SnapChat </font> that most people spend their time on. There’s less and less text to read on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more <font size="7">images </font> to look at. 
<br>
<br> Are we <font size="8">witnessing </font> a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening? 
<br> Is this <font size="9">trend </font> driven by people’s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of <font size="10">social networking </font>? </u> </br> </font>

<br>I don’t know — that’s for researchers to find out — but it feels like it’s reviving <font size="11">old </font> cultural wars. After all, the web started out by imitating <font size="12">books </font> and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext. Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies — entire monopolies — were built off the back of them. But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video <font size="13">cameras </font> grows exponentially, this seems to be changing. Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there. </p> 

<p> But the Stream, <font size="14">mobile applications </font>, and moving images: They all show a departure from a books-internet toward a television-internet. We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication — nodes and networks and links — toward a linear one, with centralization and <font size="20">hierarchies. </p> </font> </blockquote>
