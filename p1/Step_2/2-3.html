	<font face="courier"> <font size="6"> it’s <p>that text itself is disappearing. After all, </p>the first visitors to the <p> web spent their time online reading web magazines. Then came <p> blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. Now </p> it’s Facebook <p> videos and Instagram and </p> SnapChat that most <p>people spend their time on. There’s less and less text to read </p>on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more images to look at.</p>
	</p> 
<br> 
<p> Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching </p>  and listening? 
<br> Is this trend driven by </br>  people’s changing cultural habits, <p> or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking?</p>

<p>
I don’t know — that’s <p>for researchers to find out — but it feels like </p> it’s reviving old cultural wars. <p> After all, the web started </p> out by imitating books and <p> for many years, it was </p> heavily </br> dominated by <p> text, by hypertext. <p id="right">Search engines put huge value on these </p> things, and entire companies <p>— entire monopolies — were built off the back of them. </p> But as the number of <p> image scanners and digital photos </p> and video cameras grows exponentially, <p> this seems to be changing. </p> Search tools are starting to add <p>advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there. </p> 


 But the Stream, <p> mobile applications, and moving images: They </p> all show a departure from a books- <p>internet toward a</p>television-internet. <p> We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of </p>communication — nodes <p>and networks and links — toward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies. </p> </font> </blockquote></font>
